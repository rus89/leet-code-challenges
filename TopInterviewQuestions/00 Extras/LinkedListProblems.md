**Description**

One of the basic structures in algorithm which can be used to achieve lots of funny algorithms and problems.

**Problems**

There will be some of the most typical problems in this aspect, which I believe almost covers all the basic techniques that you need to solve a linked list problem.

**Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

**For example**

Given 1->1->2, return 1->2

Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.

**Solution**

We can just solve it like in an array using another index to collect the valid nodes. Here, once I made a serious mistake inserting extra `;` after `while` which directly result in an in-debuggeable situation.
